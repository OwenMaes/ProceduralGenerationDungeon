Procedural Generation: Dungeon
---

What is procedural generation?

It is a method where algorithms are used to create data, 3d-models and all sorts of in-game content. It can make larger amounts of in game content in less time. A lot of games use procedural generation, for example the number 1 sold game 'Minecraft'. The world in Minecraft is completely procedurally generated. Even older games like "The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall" used this method, most of their world is also procedurally generated. This method is used by game developers for years, but it is still not the same as handmade content. A computer can not be as original and creative as a game developer. However, another argument for the method is making the in-game content less predictable. In many games you must grind the same dungeons repeatedly. Making these dungeons different every playthrough would make them more engaging for the player. In this research project I use some of these algorithms to create a randomly generated dungeon in Unreal.
