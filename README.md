Procedural Generation: Dungeon
---

What is procedural generation?

It is a method where algorithms are used to create data, 3d-models and all sorts of in-game content. It can make larger amounts of in game content in less time. A lot of games use procedural generation, for example the number 1 sold game 'Minecraft'. The world in Minecraft is completely procedurally generated. Even older games like "The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall" used this method, most of their world is also procedurally generated. This method is used by game developers for years, but it is still not the same as handmade content. A computer can not be as original and creative as a game developer. However, another argument for the method is making the in-game content less predictable. In many games you must grind the same dungeons repeatedly. Making these dungeons different every playthrough would make them more engaging for the player. In this research project I use some of these algorithms to create a randomly generated dungeon in Unreal.

### Implementation
#### Step 1: Split the dungeon space with BSP

The dungeon space is split into multiple spaces by using the “Binary Space Partioning (BSP)” algorithm. This method recursively subdivides a space into two spaces. The dungeon space is the root of the tree, while each partitioned sub space is a leaf. The greater the split iterations the smaller the rooms. I also randomized the number of tiles each split and the direction: horizontal or vertical.

#### Step 2: Select the rooms and shrink them

Selecting the rooms is done by going through the root space, using inorder tree traversal. This method goes through the binary tree from the left to the right. During the traversal I check the current depth and if one of the two children of that space does not exist (nullptr). Which makes it a valid space to select as a dungeon room. All the dungeon rooms are shrunken after the traversal, so the rooms don’t stick together.

#### Step 3: Connect the rooms with corridors

Connecting the rooms is probably the easiest part because the BSP has already taken care of that. You just create a corridor for each space you split by connecting the the center of both spaces. I created the corridors during the first step, by using a tmap in unreal. The map holds the space id of the left child (odd id) and the variables of the corridor itself (start and endpoint).  The start point is set when we are on odd index (left of tree) and the end point is set when we are on a even index.For example: the left child has the id ‘7’ and the right child id ‘8’, the left child can access the corridor by using it’s space index (7). The right child can access the corridor by their space id (8) minus one which is 7.

#### Step 4: Converting 2D to 3D in Unreal

I use a TArray of tiles, each tile has the same size. I loop over the rooms, tile by tile and add them to the tile array. I do the same for each corridor. There are three tile types: Empty, Room and Corridor. I use the tile types to see where I can put walls and floors. I use the instanced static mesh component to quickly add and remove instances of each mesh.

### Other methods

Another way to create dungeons is to randomly create rooms (points and dimensions). Select the rooms that are not overlapping or use steering behaviour to separate all the rooms. Connect all the rooms with the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, which creates the least amount of connections and makes each room reachable.

### Conclusion
Using BSP is a very fast way to create a randomized dungeon, i can repeatdly generate a new dungeon instantly in unreal. The general efficiency is O(1), but it depends on the author’s implementation. The number of splits, number of children, and the dimensions of the spaces all impact the efficiency. 
O(n+c+(w*h))
