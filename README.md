Procedural Generation: Dungeon
---

What is procedural generation?

It's a method where algorithms are used to create data, 3d-models and all sorts of in game content. It can make larger amounts of in game content in less time. There is also a randomness to it that makes the gameplay less predictable. There are a lot of games that use procedural generation, for example the number 1 sold game 'Minecraft'. There whole world is procedurally generated. Even older games like "The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall" used this method, most of there world is procedurally generated.
